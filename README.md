# kp
This project is a reimplementation of [kpcli](http://kpcli.sourceforge.net/) with a few additional features thrown in.  It provides a shell-like interface for navigating a keepass database and manipulating entries.

Currently, a full reimplementation of all of kpcli's features is still under development, but other features, such as `search` have been added.

keepassv2+ has also been implemented, but is still very incomplete - treat it as alpha software.  It is also advisable to not use v2 at all outside of development as it's incomplete and may have edge cases where corruption can occur.

keepassv1, however, is stable and fit for use

  details      attach details <entry>
  get          attach get <entry> <filesystem location>
```

# Building
Running `make` will deploy the git hooks, lint the repo, run all the tests, then compile `kp`.  To deploy to `/usr/local/bin`, run `sudo make install`
```
> make
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
./scripts/lint.sh || exit 1

## Overview
There are two main components, the shell and the libraries that interact with the database directly.  The shell interfaces with the database through those abstractionsso that the actual logic is the same for v1 and v2.  The shell works by having individual files for each command which are strung together in `main.go`.
